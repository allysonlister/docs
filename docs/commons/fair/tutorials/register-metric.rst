How to register a Metric
======================

This tutorial explains how to register a **community FAIR Metric** using the OSTrails FAIR Assessment framework.

A Metric is a narrative description that a Test must wholly implement. Each metric should implement exactly one dimension (e.g. one of the FAIR Principles). They may be domain-agnostic or not. 
For more information, check `the FAIR Testing Resource (FTR) vocabulary <https://ostrails.github.io/FAIR_testing_resource_vocabulary/release/1.2.0/index-en.html>`_. 

There are two ways to register a Metric. The first is to use the `FAIR Wizard authoring tool <https://ostrails-fair.fair-wizard.com/wizard/dashboard>`_, a questionnaire-based knowledge model designed to collect and structure metadata for FAIR Assessment Components, including Metrics. It auto-generates FTR metadata, stores it in an OSTrails github repository and then registers it in FAIRsharing for you. This is the preferred method if you are creating a metric completely from scratch, and have not created any of the specification files yet.

The second is to register your Metric directly with FAIRsharing. This method should be used if you already have specification files (e.g. in your own project's github repository) and wish to register this metric within FAIRsharing only.

This tutorial covers both options.

Does your metric already exist?
======================
You should review existing metrics in FAIRsharing for the Principle that you are measuring. If it already exists, then please use that metric in your benchmark rather than creating a new one. To discover the metrics related to a particular Principle, find the Principle in FAIRsharing and explore its relationships.

For example, if you require a metric for F1 ((Meta)data are assigned globally unique and persistent identifiers) that checks the global uniqueness of an identifier, then visit https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.a2cea7 and review the list of related metrics. See also the tutorial on `Finding and Reusing Metrics and Benchmarks <find-metrics-and-benchmarks.html>`_.

======================

.. _metric_prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

Before starting you should:

* Create a narrative description of your metric, and how it interprets the `FAIR Principle <https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18>`_ that it measures. You may find the metric sections of the tutorial at `Defining a FAIR Benchmark with its Associated Metrics <define-benchmark-associated-metrics.html>`_ useful.
* Have access to the `FAIR Wizard authoring tool <https://ostrails-fair.fair-wizard.com/wizard/dashboard>`_.
* Identify the **type of digital object** that your Metric will evaluate.

.. _create_project:

Step 1 – Create a Metric project in the FAIR Wizard authoring tool
--------------------------------------
1. Go to `the dedicated environment for this questionnaire <https://ostrails-fair.fair-wizard.com/wizard/>`_.
2. Register yourself or log in if you already have access.
3. Navigate to Projects and click Create to start a new project.
4. Name your project and use the "**FAIR Assessment Authoring Tool** - Questionnaire for creating FAIR Assessment Components" template as Knowledge Model.
5. Enable **Filter by question tags**.
6. Choose **Metric** as the artefact type. 

By doing this, the tool will create a Metric-tailored questionnaire.

.. _fill_out_questionnaire:

Step 2 – Fill in the questionnaire
--------------------------------------

1. Read the instructions carefully. 
2. Work through the form sequentially, completing each section with information relevant to the Metric you are defining. 

Note that there are questions that are *mandatory*, which will be required to be given an answer. Other questions are optional. 
The mandatory fields that are required to define a FAIR Metric are:

- ``Title``
You should indicate the name of your Metric. To follow OSTrails best practices, consider using this Metric naming scheme:

[[Principle name]] Metric - [[Abbreviation of sub-principle]] - [[Metadata|Data depending on the focus of the metric]] - [[descriptive metric name]] 

Examples:
  
  FAIR Metric – F1– Metadata - Persistent identifiers for database content 

  FAIR4RS Metric – F1 - Metadata - Software has persistent and unique identifier (https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.87c9a8) 

- ``Description``
You should indicate a description of your Metric.

- ``Abbreviation``
You should indicate a single-word abbreviation for your Metric. Note that FAIR Wizard does not allow the use of spaces or any of these special characters in Benchmark/Metric/Test name abbreviations: : / ? # [ ] @ ! $ & ' ( ) * + , ; = "< > \ ^ { < > : " / \

To follow OSTrails best practices, consider using this Metric naming scheme:

[[Principle abbrev]]M_[[Abbreviation of sub-principle]]_[[M|D|P]]_[[short name for the metric]]  

Examples:

  FM_F1-PID_M_ARK 

  FSM_F1_M_UNIQ-ID 

  FM_R1.2_M_CPI

- ``License``
You should include a license URL for this Metric. 

- ``Version``
You should indicate the version number you are interested in using for defining your Metric. 

- ``Responsable contact person``
You should provide the name and email of a responsible contact person. You will find an ORCID-integrated browser to search for your personal information by either typing in your full name or your ORCID ID directly.

- ``Country``
You should indicate the country or geographical scope relevant to this Metric. If the Metric is not limited to a specific region, you can select *‘Worldwide’*.

- ``Subject``
You should specify the application domain or area of knowledge to which the Metric applies. If the Metric is intended to be domain-independent, you can select *‘Subject Agnostic’*.

- ``Object type``
You should indicate the type of digital object that the Metric evaluates (for example datasets, software, or workflows). If the Metric applies broadly, you can select Object type *’Agnostic’*.

- ``Taxonomy``
You should classify the Metric within a taxonomy. If no suitable classification is available or needed, you can select *’Not Applicable’*.

- ``Link to a principle``
You should link the Metric to at least one FAIR Principle. This defines which aspect of FAIRness the Metric evaluates and is essential for its interpretation and reuse.


**Please complete all optional sections that it is possible for you to complete. The more complete your metric, the more re-usable and FAIR it is. Incomplete metadata may delay the publishing of your Metric in FAIRsharing.**


Step 3 – Create an instance with your answers
--------------------------------------

Once the questionnaire has been completed:

1. Go to the **Documents** section in the top menu.
2. Name your document and select the latest version of the "*FAIR Assessment Authoring Tool* - Jinja2-based template for authoring and registering FAIR Assessment Components" as Document Template.
3. Choose the "Metric / Benchmark" Format option. 
4. Click on *Create*.

This will create a JSON file with your input. 

Step 4 – Submit your document
--------------------------------------

Now, you can review the document with your answers to the questionnaire, by clicking on it, which will initiate the download of the file. Once you're happy with it, you're ready to submit your document:

4. In the **Documents** section, click the three dots icon (⋯) beside your document.
5. Select *Submit*.

The submission will be sent via the GitHub API to be registered in an `OSTrails GitHub repository for collecting metadata about these assessment components <https://github.com/OSTrails/assessment-component-metadata-records>`_, and indexed by the `FAIRsharing <https://fairsharing.org/>`_ registry.


Next steps
----------

Once submitted to FAIRsharing, the record will remain hidden until approved by the FAIRsharing curation team. Once made public, claim your record in FAIRsharing. Information on creating an account and claiming a record is available in the next section, and at https://fairsharing.gitbook.io/
